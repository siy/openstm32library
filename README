This repository is aimed to contain various libraries for OpenSTM32 project 
(see https://github.com/gbulmer/openstm32sw and https://github.com/gbulmer/openstm32hw)

General approach to repository layout:

Top level subdirectories:

\- human-interface                     <- Everything related to LCD/OLED/TFT/LED displays, keyboards, etc.
\- networking-communication-navigation <- Ethernet, Wi-Fi, GSM, GPS, BT, ZigBee, RF, etc.
\- sensors-conversion                  <- Everything related to sensors (temperature, humidity, acceleration, etc.) and DAC/ADC.
\- control                             <- All things related to power control/lighting/motors/etc.)
\- algorithms                          <- Useful general purpose code, statistics, signal processing, control algorithms (such as PID), etc.

Suggested library layout:

\- <top level directory>
   \- <chip/module/board/algorithm name>
     \- wirish       <- class, header and other stuff necessary to enable use of library in Maple IDE (optional for non-wiring libraries)
     \- examples     <- optional examples for library
     \- hardware     <- optional hardware designs (breakout boards, etc.)
     \- src          <- library sources (optional, but suggested for general purpose algorithms and non-wiring libraries)
     README          <- library README
